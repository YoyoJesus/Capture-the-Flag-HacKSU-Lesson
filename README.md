# Capture The Flag HacKSU Lesson
### Hosted By Austin Sternberg

## What is a CTF?
CTFs or Capture the Flag challenges are much like the classic game you might have played as a child. CTFs involve two main things:
- There is some kind of flag that obscured from plain view (hidden)
- Some kind of cybersecurity principle hiding the flag

A common and very popular way to find these challenges is to participate in a CTF competition. My personal favorite is Carnegie Mellon's yearly picoCTF event, which is typically held in March or April. These events are typically set up online, though I have seen a few that were in person, typically as part of a hackathon.

### CTF's also tend to break challenges into categories:
- Web Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Forensics
- General Skills
- Binary Exploitation

Tonight's lesson will go over an easy challenge from each of these categories

The premise of these challenges then is to use a variety of cybersecurity skills and tools to attempt to get the code, file, or website to spit out a flag.

## What are the tools?
Though each CTF is technically different, I can suggest these main tools:

- [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/)
- [CTF Toolkit](https://ctftoolkit.com/)
- [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

Each of these will provide nearly all of the tools required for any CTF challenge, baring very specific ones. dcode.fr is better for cipher brute-forcing, were CTF Toolkit provides everything else.

## How Do I Get Started?
- Make an account on [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/register)
- Click on 'Practice' to enter the challenge gym

## What will this lesson cover?
I am aiming to cover one easy challenge across each of the categories that the pico gym provides. Many of the challenges have been used a actual challenges used in previous picoCTF competitions.

I will be going over the following challenges:
- heap 0
- Mod 26
- CanYouSee
- what's a netcat?
- Transformation
- Scavenger Hunt

My writeups (instructions) for solving these challenges are available as part of this repository. Unlike most write ups, I do not provide the whole flag at the end, as a way to encourage actually trying to follow my steps.
